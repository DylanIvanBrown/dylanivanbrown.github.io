## AI Usage on This Blog

This blog is an experiment and learning experience for me. As such I've used various AI tools to help put it together. The ideas of the blog are entirely my own. This is not a place for AI slop.

### How AI is Used

- **Writing Assistance**: AI tools are only used to help edit and refine the ways in which I word my own ideas.
- **Code Development**: AI tools have been used in developing and maintaining the blog's technical infrastructure, based on some concepts I had for the approach. I'm not a frontend developer, so allowing the tools to handle the details of the CSS etc has allowed me to focus on the content of the blog, which is the point of it's existence.


### Transparency

I believe in being transparent about the tools I use. As technology evolves, so will my approach to using AI responsibly in content creation.
